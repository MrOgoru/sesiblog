                    paid by client is a function of ad rates, bouquet, ad type, ad platform etc. eg if a client want a
                    5000 audience (ie bouquet) for an advert rate of 1.5, (banner), the client will pay (5000 x 1.5) +
                    25% of (5000 x 1.5). the 25% is for MAA while the (5000 x 1.5) is for broadcasters who distributed
                    the adverts to their friends, each broadcasters get 1.5 x No of friends who received and see the
