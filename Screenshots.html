            At first I thought this was another <b><i>"get-rich-scam"</i></b> but I was surprised at the simplicity and
            genuineness of this. <br>No registration fee, no third party intervention, no referral, just me, my smart
            phone, at my own convenience, my choice of advert. Come to think of it, I actually rendered a service by
            sharing third party adverts to my friends and my data used; which MAA deems fit to be compensated for. <br>

            MAA is a easy and secure way of making money. You should share this amazing platforms with your friends.
